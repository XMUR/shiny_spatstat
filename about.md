## Kimboto trees at Paracou, French Guiana


### Description

This dataset is a point pattern of adult and juvenile Kimboto trees (*Pradosia cochlearia* or *P. ptychandra*) recorded at Paracou in French Guiana. See Flores (2005).

The dataset paracou is a point pattern (object of class **"ppp"**) containing the spatial coordinates of each tree, marked by age (a factor with levels adult and juvenile). The survey region is a rectangle approximately 400 by 525 metres. Coordinates are given in metres.

Note that the data contain duplicated points (two points at the same location). To determine which points are duplicates, use **duplicated.ppp**. To remove the duplication, use **unique.ppp**.


### Usage

`data(paracou)`
